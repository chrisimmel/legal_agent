Case Number: ICSID-ARB/22/004  
Title: Global Ventures v. Republic of Zanbia  
Jurisdiction: ICSID Tribunal (UK–Zanbia BIT)  
Date: March 8, 2022  
Tribunal: Petrova (Chair), Okoro, Tan  

Parties & Counsel:  
• Claimant: Global Ventures Ltd. (counsel: White & Case)  
• Respondent: Zanbia (counsel: Govt. Legal Dept.)

Background:  
Under the 1998 UK–Zanbia BIT, GV invested USD 50M mining concession subject to environmental review. License revoked Jan 2020.

Procedural History:  
Notice Aug 2020; preliminary objections denied Nov 2020.

Facts:  
– Zanbia cites non-compliance with environmental regs.  
– No written warnings or remediation opportunity provided.

Legal Issues:  
1. Indirect expropriation under Art. 6 BIT.  
2. Fair compensation standard (prompt, adequate, effective).

Party Arguments:  
- **GV:** Revocation equivalent to deprivation of property.  
- **Zanbia:** Legitimate regulatory action in public interest.

Legal Standard:  
Salini test for indirect expropriation; Chorzów Factory principle for compensation.

Analysis:  
Tribunal finds revocation disproportionate, lacked procedural safeguards. Regulatory act crossed into expropriation.

Award:  
Compensation USD 35M + 5% compound interest from Jan 2020. Costs split 60/40. Unanimous.
