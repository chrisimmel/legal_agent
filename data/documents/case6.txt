Case Number: FCA-2022-302  
Title: Nguyen v. Commonwealth Bank of Australia  
Jurisdiction: Federal Court of Australia  
Date: October 14, 2022  
Judge: Justice Helen Murphy  

Parties & Counsel:  
• Plaintiff: Minh Nguyen (counsel: Herbert Smith Freehills)  
• Defendant: CBA (counsel: Allens Linklaters)  

Background:  
Nguyen wired USD 200,000 via CBA from Singapore to Sydney. Bank’s staff mis-keyed SWIFT code, causing loss.

Procedural History:  
Filed under tort law Mar 2022; cross-motions for summary judgment heard Sept.

Facts:  
– Internal protocol requires dual verification.  
– Bank records show only single check.

Legal Issues:  
1. Duty of care in international transfers.  
2. Causation and remoteness under Donoghue v. Stevenson.

Party Arguments:  
- **Nguyen:** Standard of care breached.  
- **CBA:** Relies on client-provided instructions; no deeper duty.

Legal Standard:  
Banking duty of care recognized in Farah Constructions v. Say-Dee (2007).

Analysis:  
Court finds CBA owes elevated duty when processing instructions; breach clear. Loss direct and foreseeable.

Holding & Costs:  
Judgment for Nguyen: AUD 270,000 + 5% interest from Feb 2022; AUD 15,000 costs. No appeal noted.
