Title: Johnson v. Barclays Bank PLC  
Jurisdiction: London High Court, Commercial Court  
Date: November 9, 2020  
Judge: Sir Andrew Collins  

Parties & Counsel:  
• Claimant: Emily Johnson (counsel: Harrington & Co.)  
• Defendant: Barclays Bank PLC (counsel: Linklaters LLP)  

Background:  
Johnson purchased a 5-year structured note in Apr 2019 marketed as “capital-protected, high-yield.” Returns plummeted in Mar 2020 market crash.

Procedural History:  
Claim issued Aug 2020 under FSMA 2000. Barclays’ strike-out application denied Sept.

Facts:  
– Promotional brochure: “Guaranteed 5% p.a.”  
– Risk disclosures in Section 3 small-print.  

Legal Issues:  
1. Breach of s.138D(1) FSMA: fair, clear, non-misleading info.  
2. Adequacy under FCA COB rules.

Parties’ Arguments:  
- **Johnson:** Reasonable investor misled by emphasis on returns.  
- **Barclays:** Full disclosure present; investor risk awareness.

Legal Standard:  
“Fair, clear and not misleading” assessed by objective reasonable investor test (see Collidge v. UBS, 2012).

Analysis:  
Contrasting bold headlines vs. tiny risk section, Court finds imbalance. Investor likely to overlook downside; FCA’s spirit breached.

Holding & Remedy:  
Barclays to pay £23,000 net loss + 4% interest from claim date and £5,000 costs. No punitive damages.
