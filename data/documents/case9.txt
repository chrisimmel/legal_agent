Title: Andersson v. Council of Europe  
Jurisdiction: ECHR, Grand Chamber  
Date: July 22, 2020  
Judges: Panel of 7  

Parties & Counsel:  
• Applicant: Lars Andersson (pro bono)  
• Respondent: Council of Europe (Secretary General’s office)  

Background:  
Andersson’s extradition delayed 30 months due to successive adjournments.

Procedural History:  
Chamber judgment Mar 2020 found violation; referred to Grand Chamber.

Facts:  
– Delays due to procedural re-filings and ministerial review.  
– No interim remedies sought effectively.

Legal Issues:  
1. Breach of Art. 6(1) “reasonable time.”  
2. Appropriate remedy under Art. 41.

Party Arguments:  
- **Andersson:** State failed to justify lengthy adjournments.  
- **Council:** Complexity justified some delays.

Legal Standard:  
“Reasonable time” balancing complexity vs. applicant’s interests (Kudła v. Poland).

Analysis:  
Grand Chamber finds delays excessive given straightforward extradition. State had alternate mechanisms to expedite.

Holding:  
Violation Art. 6(1). €8,000 non-pecuniary damages + €3,500 costs. No dissent.
