Case Number: NYSC-2021-0456  
Title: Smith v. Acme Corp.  
Jurisdiction: New York Supreme Court, Commercial Division  
Date: June 15, 2021  
Judge: Hon. Maria Gonzales  

Parties & Counsel:  
• Plaintiff: John Smith (counsel: Baker & Myers LLP)  
• Defendant: Acme Corp. (counsel: Richards, Lee & Co.)  

Background:  
Smith was recruited in 2018 as Senior Sales Manager on a 3-year contract guaranteeing “cause-only” termination, plus a quarterly performance bonus of 20% base salary. In Dec 2020, Acme accused him of policy breaches, terminated him without notice, and withheld his Q4 bonus.

Procedural History:  
Filed Mar 2021; Acme’s motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust the internal grievance process was denied Apr 2021. Parties exchanged discovery by June.

Facts:  
– Cl. 8.2 requires 30-day notice or pay in lieu.  
– Bonus clause: “The Company shall pay…”  
– Smith denies any misconduct; Acme points to two email warnings in Nov 2020.

Legal Issues:  
1. Did Acme breach the notice/pay-in-lieu clause?  
2. Is the bonus entitlement mandatory or discretionary?  

Parties’ Arguments:  
- **Smith:** Clause is unambiguous; bonus is “shall.”  
- **Acme:** Warnings triggered “for cause” exception.  

Legal Standard:  
Contract interpretation under Corbin’s “plain meaning” rule; extrinsic evidence only if ambiguous.

Analysis:  
Court finds warnings were informal performance notes, not “cause” under Cl. 2.1. Bonus language “shall” creates a duty; failure to pay is breach.

Holding & Relief:  
Judgment for Smith. Damages: $45,000 back pay, $12,500 bonus, pre-judgment interest at 9%, and $2,000 costs. No injunctive relief.
