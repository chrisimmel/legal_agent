Case Number: SCC-2023-0019  
Title: Tremblay v. Canada Post Corporation  
Jurisdiction: Supreme Court of Canada  
Date: January 19, 2023  
Justices: McLachlin C.J., Abella and Côté JJ.  

Parties & Counsel:  
• Appellant: Marie Tremblay (counsel: Blake, Cassels & Graydon)  
• Respondent: CPC (counsel: Department of Justice Canada)  

Background:  
Tremblay’s P.O. box suspended for non-payment of $25 fee; critical medical docs undelivered.

Procedural History:  
Quebec CA upheld CPC’s policy; SCC granted leave Oct 2022.

Facts:  
– Policy: automatic suspension after 30 days non-payment.  
– No individualized notice beyond generic reminder.

Legal Issues:  
1. Does mail delivery engage s.7 Charter?  
2. Does policy violate “principles of fundamental justice”?

Party Arguments:  
- **Tremblay:** Mail is essential life-support service.  
- **CPC:** Fee policy is administrative, not a Charter matter.

Legal Standard:  
Applying Oakes test for overbreadth (R v. Oakes, 1986).

Analysis:  
Majority finds service indispensable to life-liberty; policy overbroad, no meaningful notice. Proportionality fails.

Holding:  
Appeal allowed; policy invalid; remit for redesign. No costs. Abella JJ concurs; Côté JJ dissenting, arguing administrative policy not subject to s.7.
