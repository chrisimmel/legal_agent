Case Number: KHC-2021-2104  
Title: Kumar v. State of Kerala  
Jurisdiction: Kerala High Court, Writ Jurisdiction  
Date: December 5, 2021  
Judge: Justice Anil Menon  

Parties & Counsel:  
• Petitioner: Rajesh Kumar (counsel: Kochery & Co.)  
• Respondent: State of Kerala (counsel: AG’s Office)  

Background:  
Under KMC Act 1994 §215, municipality may demolish unauthorized structures after hearing.

Procedural History:  
Writ filed Oct 2021; interim stay granted.

Facts:  
– Demolition notice delivered to wrong address.  
– Survey used unverified GPS data; no triangulation.

Legal Issues:  
1. Violation of audi alteram partem (Art. 14 IPC).  
2. Validity of survey report.

Party Arguments:  
- **Kumar:** No hearing; survey flawed.  
- **State:** Emergency public safety justified summary order.

Legal Standard:  
Natural justice principles in administrative action (Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India).

Analysis:  
Court finds notice jurisdictional; survey inadmissible without calibration. Public safety argument fails absent immediate hazard evidence.

Holding & Directive:  
Demolition quashed. Municipality to re-issue proper notice, conduct hearing, fresh survey within 90 days. ₹20,000 costs awarded. Concurring opinion: propose guidelines for remote-notice service.
