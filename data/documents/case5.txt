Case Number: SIAC-2021-045  
Title: Li v. Singapore Telecommunications Ltd.  
Jurisdiction: SIAC Arbitration (Rules 2016)  
Date: May 27, 2021  
Arbitrator: Prof. Wong Wei Lun  

Parties & Counsel:  
• Claimant: Ms. Li (counsel: Rajah & Tann)  
• Respondent: SingTel (counsel: Drew & Napier)  

Background:  
Li’s expatriate contract guaranteed 60‐day notice or compensation. SingTel alleged she worked remotely without approval, breaching confidentiality Art. 15.

Procedural History:  
Commenced July 2020; hearing in Feb 2021; briefs closed Mar.

Facts:  
– Li’s email logs show continuous reporting.  
– SingTel’s HR policy: progressive discipline.

Legal Issues:  
1. Breach of notice clause Art. 12.  
2. Justification under confidentiality Art. 15.

Party Arguments:  
- **Li:** No misconduct; clause mandatory.  
- **SingTel:** Email logs show policy breach warranting summary dismissal.

Legal Standard:  
Arbitrator applies Singapore Contract Law: strict textual interpretation.

Analysis:  
Award finds no prima facie evidence of unauthorized disclosure. SingTel circumvented its own policy by bypassing progressive discipline required under employee handbook.

Holding & Award:  
SingTel to pay SGD 180,000 for notice + lost benefits, plus SGD 10,000 costs. Dissenting note: arbitrator warns parties to update termination policies.
