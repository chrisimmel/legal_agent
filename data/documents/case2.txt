Case Number: DHC-2022-1120  
Title: Patel v. Government of Delhi  
Jurisdiction: Delhi High Court, Taxation Bench  
Date: August 3, 2022  
Judge: Hon. Ritu Mahajan  

Parties & Counsel:  
• Petitioner: Arun Patel (counsel: Verma & Associates)  
• Respondent: MCD (counsel: Govt. Advocate Office)  

Background:  
Under the Municipal Tax Act, 2008, MCD assesses industrial property tax via prescribed slab valuations. Patel’s factory assessed at ₹10.5 cr in Jan 2022 triggered demand notice.

Procedural History:  
Writ petition filed Apr 2022 with stay on collection; counter-affidavit filed May 2022.

Facts:  
– Notice lacked slab‐by‐slab worksheet and comparables list.  
– Patel failed to file time-barred objections in Feb 2022.  

Legal Issues:  
1. Validity of notice under Sec. 78(2) MTA.  
2. Whether procedural lapse vitiates assessment.

Parties’ Arguments:  
- **Patel:** Notice denied meaningful objection—violation of Audi alteram partem.  
- **MCD:** Notice complied with Form-A; procedural errors are curable.

Legal Standard:  
Natural justice in tax matters requires full disclosure of valuation data (see Delhi Mun. Corp. v. Garg, 2015).

Analysis:  
Court cites Garg: omission of critical data renders notice void; time-bar is subordinate to principles of natural justice when notice itself is flawed.

Holding & Orders:  
Assessment quashed. MCD to re-assess within 60 days with detailed notice. ₹50,000 awarded for costs. No further stay.
