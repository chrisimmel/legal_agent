Case Number: CA-2023-0091  
Title: Renault SA v. Peugeot SA  
Jurisdiction: Cour d’appel de Paris, 3ème chambre  
Date: February 12, 2023  
Judge: Mme Chantal Dubois  

Parties & Counsel:  
• Appellant: Renault SA (counsel: Gide Loyrette Nouel)  
• Respondent: Peugeot SA (counsel: CMS Bureau Francis Lefebvre)  

Background:  
Renault’s patent FR-2015-1234 covers a 5-component variable injector. Peugeot’s X-Flow launched in 2021 allegedly replicates Cl. 3’s pressure valve.

Procedural History:  
First-instance in 2022: patent invalidity refusal. Renault appealed Jan 2023.

Facts:  
– Claim construction under C.P.I. L. 613-14.  
– Prior art: Gebra 2010 lacking flow-control ring.

Legal Issues:  
1. Proper interpretation of claims.  
2. Anticipation by prior art.

Parties’ Arguments:  
- **Renault:** X-Flow embodies each embryonic element.  
- **Peugeot:** design differences “manner of operation” circumvent coverage.

Legal Standard:  
Article 3 of the EPC Protocol: purposive construction, “informed person” test.

Analysis:  
Court applies Directive 2004/25: focuses on technical effect. X-Flow’s valve identical in operation. Gebra lacks element Cl. 3’s calibrated orifice.

Holding:  
Appeal granted. Injunction issued; damages €1.2 M + €150 K procedural. No dissent.
