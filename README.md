# Legal Research Agent

A simple multi-agent system for legal document research and analysis. The system uses a small set of AI agents to plan, execute, and reflect on research tasks to provide comprehensive answers to legal queries.

NOTE: This is just a simple proof of concept, not intended for any real use.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Planner, Executor, and Reflector agents work together
- **Intelligent Planning**: Automatically creates step-by-step research plans
- **Vector Database Search**: Semantic search across legal documents
- **Document Processing**: PDF to markdown conversion with OCR support
- **Iterative Refinement**: Agents reflect on and improve their work
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Synthesizes information across multiple documents

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
uv sync
```

### 2. Set up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

### 3. Try it out with a Legal Research Query
```bash
python orchestrator.py "Cite an example of a case involving breach of contract, and tell me who prevailed in the case."
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Research Query
```bash
 python orchestrator.py "Name the respondent in a case in which damages were awarded."
```

### Complex Multi-Step Analysis
```bash
python orchestrator.py "What types of legal proceedings are represented and what were their outcomes?"
```

### Document-Specific Research
```bash
python orchestrator.py "What are the main arguments in cases involving contract disputes?"
```

### Topic Research
```bash
python orchestrator.py "Find all references to intellectual property disputes?"
```

## Setup and Configuration

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- uv package manager
- OpenAI API key (for embeddings and LLM access)

### Document Preparation
The test document set is pre-installed and requires no preparation. However, it is trivial to
ingest other text documents by putting them in the `data/documents` folder and ensuring they
ollow the format of the existing files there.

It is also possible to adapt the code in `pdf_to_markdown_ocr.py` to extract text from PDF
documents.

## How it Works

### Multi-Agent System
The research agent uses three specialized AI agents:

1. **PlannerAgent** (`agents/planner.py`)
   - Analyzes user queries and creates a research plan
   - Breaks complex questions into manageable steps
   - Considers document types and research scope

2. **StepExecutorAgent** (`agents/step_executor.py`)
   - If needed, finds pertinent documents using semantic search
   - Executes a single step of the plan

3. **StepReflectorAgent** (`agents/step_reflector.py`)
   - Evaluates the quality and completeness of each step
   - Determines if steps need to be retried or refined
   - Ensures high-quality research outputs


An `AgentOrchestrator` coordinates all agents and works through the steps until the research is complete.

Chroma is used as the vector store for the legal documents.

```bash
python orchestrator.py "Cite an example of a case involving breach of contract, and tell me who prevailed in the case."
```

Step 2 failed
Reflector notes: The CURRENT_STEP required presenting a concise, clearly formatted response citing an example breach of contract case and stating who prevailed. The response cites a case (Li v. Singapore Telecommunications Ltd.) and clearly states the facts, legal issue, and prevailing party. However, the result indicates this case was not sourced from the current search or provided legal documents‚Äîrather, it was supplied from prior knowledge or internal memory because no relevant breach of contract case was found in the available set.

The step's objective was to use information from the actual search/documents, not from prior knowledge. Therefore, the step is unsuccessful. To improve, the executor should explicitly state that no breach of contract case was found in the retrieved materials and that it was not possible to fulfill the user query based on the available sources, rather than providing an unsourced or 'stand-in' example. If appropriate, the response should transparently mention the limitation and avoid fabricating or inserting cases not tied to retrieved evidence.

Reflector notes: The executor has successfully completed the current step. The response is concise, clearly formatted, and cites a specific breach of contract case, including relevant facts, the legal issue, the outcome, and who prevailed (Ms. Li). The arbitrator's decision and key reasoning are summarized, and the case citation is provided. The response fulfills the user query and the objectives of the step, with no significant omissions or errors.

============================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
============================================================
Example Case: Li v. Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. (SIAC-2021-045)

Facts: Ms. Li was employed by Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. (SingTel) on an expatriate contract guaranteeing a 60-day notice period or equivalent compensation if terminated. SingTel terminated Li, alleging breach of a confidentiality clause (Art. 15) by claiming she worked remotely without approval. Li asserted she had fulfilled her reporting duties and that the notice requirement was mandatory.

Legal Issue: Whether SingTel was justified in summarily dismissing Li for the alleged breach, thus avoiding the contractual obligation to give notice or pay compensation.

Decision and Prevailing Party: The arbitrator, applying Singapore Contract Law, found no substantive evidence of unauthorized disclosure by Li and further noted that SingTel failed to follow its own progressive discipline procedures. The award ordered SingTel to pay Ms. Li SGD 180,000 for notice and lost benefits, plus costs. Therefore, Ms. Li prevailed in the case.

Notice that the agents reflect on the result of each step and are prepared to retry as necessary (see "‚ö†Ô∏è  Step needs retry" in the log).



## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Missing API Keys**: Ensure ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set
2. **No Documents Found**: Check that documents exist in `data/documents/`
3. **Vector Store Empty**: Run document processing pipeline first
4. **Step Execution Failures**: Check document quality and query complexity
